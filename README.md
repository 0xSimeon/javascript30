# JavaScript30

As part of my commitment to improve my Javascript skills, I'm taking [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com) - A 30-day practical course/program by **Wes Bos**.

After going through each day's content, I will update this README file with my thoughts. 

## Day 1
+ **Project**: Javascript Keyboard Drum kit.
+  **Thoughts**: This project is an eye-opener for me for new stuffs. It's actually the first time I worked with the audio element in HTML5 and audio methods in javascript like `audio.play()` - which is used for playing audio and `audio.currentTime()` - used for rewinding and audio from the beginning. I also worked with basic selector methods in javascript like `document.querySelector()` & `document.querySelectorAll()` which have both become familiar tools in my tool-box in recent time. Tomorrow's project is about making a JS-CSS analog clock. I will make sure to report back. Over and out. 
+  Todo: Make it pretty and add footer!

## Day 2
+ **Project**: Updating CSS Variables with js.
+  **Thoughts**:  Today's practice wasn't much of a project but still, It was packed. I learnt more about setting up custom attributes with the `data-` attributes. Before now, I've used data attributes but didn't fully understand them (It just got the job done 😉). I also learnt that `.dataset` returns an object with all the data attributes on that element. Before now, I only do `data-attribute` to get the specific data attribute I needed. Aside from these, the rest of day 2 was mainly a practice for me. 
+  Todo: Scope it to the control `div`.
