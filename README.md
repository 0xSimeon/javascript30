# JavaScript30

As part of my commitment to improve my Javascript skills, I'm taking [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com) - A 30-day practical course/program by **Wes Bos**.

After going through each day's content, I will update this README file with my thoughts. 

## Day 1
+ **Project**: Javascript Keyboard Drum kit.
+  **Thoughts**: This project is an eye-opener for me for new stuffs. It's actually the first time I worked with the audio element in HTML5 and audio methods in javascript like `audio.play()` - which is used for playing audio and `audio.currentTime()` - used for rewinding and audio from the beginning. I also worked with basic selector methods in javascript like `document.querySelector()` & `document.querySelectorAll()` which have both become familiar tools in my tool-box in recent time. Tomorrow's project is about making a JS-CSS analog clock. I will make sure to report back. Over and out.
